            Censorship on social media is a contested issue. On one hand, platforms 
            regulate harmful or misleading content, but on the other, they are often 
            criticised for removing posts that challenge authority or raise sensitive 
            issues. This raises questions about freedom of expression and who gets to 
            decide what remains visible online.

            These tensions contribute to what’s commonly called <em>cancel culture</em>, 
            where public opinion can amplify calls to silence individuals or groups. 
            While sometimes justified as a form of accountability, it can also reinforce 
            conformity, discouraging people from expressing dissenting or creative ideas. 
            The debate continues: is this regulation protecting users, or narrowing 
            public discourse?
