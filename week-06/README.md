# Week 6 — CSS Animations

This week dives into CSS animations, from simple spins to combining multiple effects.

## Exercises
1. **Spinning Text** — Rotate text with `@keyframes`.
2. **Animated Letters and Linking Pages** — Animate characters one by one.
3. **Cycling Text Colours** — Change colours over time.
4. **Flashing Sequential Messages** — Reveal text in sequence.
5. **Moving Text Inside a Box** — Animate position with `transform`.
6. **Animated Background Gradient** — Transition background colours.
7. **Combining Multiple Animations** — Layer different animations together.

## Tips
- Always define both the starting and ending state in `@keyframes`.  
- Use `animation-iteration-count: infinite;` for looping.  
- Small changes can create big effects — don’t overcomplicate.
