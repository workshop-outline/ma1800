        After the first website went live at CERN in 1991, the World Wide Web 
        quickly began to spread beyond the research community. A key moment came 
        in 1993 with the release of 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)" target="_blank">NCSA Mosaic</a>, 
        the first widely used graphical web browser developed by Marc Andreessen 
        and his team at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications in Illinois.

        Mosaic made the web accessible to non-technical users by supporting images 
        and text on the same page — a feature we now take for granted. Its popularity 
        helped spark a wave of interest in the web, leading to a rapid growth of 
        websites across universities, companies, and eventually the public.

        In 1994, Tim Berners-Lee founded the 
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>, 
        an international community that develops open standards to ensure the web 
        remains free and accessible. The W3C continues to guide the development of 
        core technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
