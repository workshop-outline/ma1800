      Exercise summary:
      This exercise shows how to combine a longer article with images,
      captions, and a navigation tray at the bottom. 

      You’ll practise structuring content semantically while keeping 
      navigation consistent across pages.

        The World Wide Web was invented in 1989 by 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="_blank">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, 
        a British computer scientist at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research). 
        His goal was to make it easier for researchers around the world to share information 
        across different computer systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        In March 1989, Berners-Lee wrote his first proposal for an 
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html" target="_blank">information management system</a>, 
        outlining the basic ideas of hypertext and linking documents together. 
        The system would eventually evolve into what we know today as the World Wide Web.

        By 1990, working with Belgian systems engineer 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau" target="_blank">Robert Cailliau</a>, 
        Berners-Lee had created the first web browser and editor, called 
        <i>WorldWideWeb</i>, and the first web server, running on a NeXT computer at CERN.

          “This machine is a server. DO NOT POWER IT DOWN!”

        The first website, launched in 1991, explained what the web was and 
        how to create web pages using HTML. 
        You can still view a
