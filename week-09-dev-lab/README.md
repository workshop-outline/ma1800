# Week 9 — Interactivity and JavaScript Experiments

This week introduces JavaScript experiments. You’ll try out basic interactions that make your pages more dynamic.

## Exercises
1. **Hover to Reveal an Image**  
2. **Animated Messages with Delays**  
3. **iPhone Simulation with Scrollable Text**  
4. **Password-Protected Reveal**  
5. **Simulated Chatbox**

## Tips
- JavaScript is about logic: *if this happens → then do that*.  
- Use `<script src="script.js"></script>` to keep JS in its own file.  
- Don’t worry about learning JS fully — just experiment.  
- Keep your code simple and focus on interaction ideas.
