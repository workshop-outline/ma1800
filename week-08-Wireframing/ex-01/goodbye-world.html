    <h1>Goodbye World!</h1>

    <p>
      Despite his early influence on hypertext theory, Nelson struggled to bring 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu" target="_blank">Project Xanadu</a> 
      to completion. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, new technologies emerged that 
      overshadowed his vision, most notably Tim Berners-Lee’s invention of the 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank">World Wide Web</a> 
      in 1989. The web achieved global adoption because it was simpler and easier 
      to implement, even though Nelson criticised it as a weak imitation of his 
      more ambitious ideas.

      Nelson continued to refine his work, publishing 
      <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_Machines" target="_blank">Literary Machines</a></i> 
      (1981) and advocating for “deep links” and “transclusion” — concepts that still 
      influence digital media and web design. While Project Xanadu never reached 
      mainstream use, Nelson’s ideas remain part of the conversation about how we 
      might design fairer, more interconnected information systems. His legacy lies 
      not in a finished system, but in inspiring generations of thinkers, artists, 
      and technologists to imagine alternatives to the web as we know it.
