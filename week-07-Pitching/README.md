# Week 7 — Project Pitching

This week is about presenting your project ideas. No coding — focus on explaining your concept.

## Pitching Session
- Present your idea for a web artwork.  
- Show quick sketches, mock-ups, or references.  
- Get feedback from peers and tutor.

## Tips for a Strong Pitch
- Keep it clear: What does your web artwork aim to communicate?
- Connect it to ideas we’ve explored (hypertext, memes, CSS, etc.).  
- Think about how users will **experience** your work.  
- Don’t worry about finishing the work now — just show direction.  
- Inspiration counts as much as execution at this stage.
