        Exercise 3 Summary:
        This workshop shows how to embed text content inside the shape of an image 
        (in this case, an iPhone frame) so it looks like the text is displayed 
        on the phone screen. By controlling the size and scroll behaviour of the 
        article content, learners experiment with matching text and image layout 
        to simulate a mobile interface.

        <h1>The Pressure of Social Media</h1>
        
        <h2 class="hide">
          censorship, cancel culture &amp; social conformity
        </h2>

        <div id="article">
          <p>
            We've all felt pressurised by social media whether we admit it or
            not (or whether we've been able to identify it or not). Why is it
            that we let something unseen and unknown, or more specifically,
            someone online dictate our feelings and choices?
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Social media pressure refers to the virtual pressure put on a
            group or an individual to behave, feel or act in a certain manner. 
            The pressure can be negative; particularly regarding body image, 
            financial insecurity and number of followers/likes. However, it can 
            also be positive; justice and accountability for actions, knowledge, 
            charity and awareness. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Negative influence increases the tendency to compare your
            life or appearance to others, leaving you feeling inadequate or 
            inferior. This can lead to cyberhate, mental illness and cancel 
            culture, while also spreading misinformation and creating panic. 
            Positive influence increases awareness of otherwise censored topics, 
            encourages good deeds, spreads news quickly, holds people and 
            authorities accountable for their actions, and provides solidarity.
