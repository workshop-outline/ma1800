# Week 8 — Wireframing and Navigation

This week focuses on planning and structuring interactive projects. Wireframing helps you visualise layout and navigation before coding.

## Exercises
1. **Multi-Page Navigation (Project Xanadu Example)**  
2. **Flexible Layout with Content Boxes**  
3. **Web Foundations: The Early Web**  
4. **Image Grid with Net Art Examples**  
5. **Split-Screen Layout Choices**  
6. **Flexbox Image Gallery**

## Tips for Wireframing (Web Art focus)
- Don’t think of it as a corporate website — focus on *experience*.  
- Wireframes can be sketches, diagrams, or simple boxes.  
- Consider navigation flows that are non-linear or playful.  
- Emphasise **conceptual design**, not rigid grids.  
- Ask: how do form and structure reflect your idea?
