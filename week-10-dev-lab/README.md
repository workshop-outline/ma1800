# Week 10 â€” Development Lab: Prepare for Submission

This final session is a support and troubleshooting lab. No new coding concepts are introduced. Instead, this time is dedicated to helping you prepare your **Final Project submission** and resolve any last-minute technical issues.

## Objectives
- Finalise your project files and folder structure.  
- Review and prepare your submission ZIP file.  
- Ensure your README.md is complete and clearly written.  
- Troubleshoot technical issues with your tutor if needed.  
- Ask last-minute questions about coding, design, or submission requirements.  

## Submission Instructions
- Submit a **single ZIP file** (less than 100MB) via Turnitin.  
- The ZIP must contain your HTML and CSS files for the Final Project.  
- Name your file:  


Replace `XXXXXX` with your **candidate number**.  
- Your code must include **code comments**.  
- The project must contain a **README.md** with:  
1. A link to your website hosted on GitHub Pages  
2. A description of your project idea, context, functionality, and any challenges encountered  
3. A summary of the case studies from seminars that influenced your work  
4. A reflection on how you would extend the project with more time or resources  
5. A list of assets you created and those sourced online (images, sound, video, drawings, GIFs, etc.)  

## Suggested Activities in this Session
- Review your code by testing different functionality in multiple browsers.  
- Check that all important aspects of your web artwork (navigation, layout, styling, interactivity) work as expected.  
- Confirm your GitHub Pages link loads correctly.  
- Ask questions about unresolved bugs, errors, or file organisation.  
- Peer review: exchange feedback with classmates.  

## Hints
- Keep your code neat, commented, and well structured.  
- Organise your folders clearly (e.g. `/assets/`, `/css/`).  
- Use this session to make sure your project is submission-ready.
