  <h1>Week 5 — GIF Animation and Meme Culture</h1>

  <p>
    This week we are exploring <b>GIF animation</b> and its role in <b>internet culture</b>. 
    GIFs (Graphics Interchange Format) were first introduced in the late 1980s and 
    became a defining part of the early web. Their looping quality and small file size 
    made them perfect for sharing, long before video streaming was widely possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    In online spaces, GIFs have become more than just moving images. They are used to 
    <b>communicate emotions</b>, <b>share jokes</b>, and <b>create memes</b>. Meme culture 
    has helped GIFs spread rapidly, turning them into a universal internet language. 
    Their popularity also comes from how easy they are to remix and repurpose — 
    reflecting the participatory nature of digital culture.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this session, we will use <a href="https://www.gimp.org/downloads/" target="_blank">GIMP</a> 
    to create simple GIF animations, and then learn how to embed and style them in a web page. 
    These exercises demonstrate how GIFs can shape the look and feel of a site, as well as how they 
    connect to wider cultural practices of looping, repetition, and humour.
